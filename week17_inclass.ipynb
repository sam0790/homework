    "### 1. Write simple (straightforward) definitions for the following parameters for RandomForestClassifier (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) and indicate how they correlate with the precision and recall for the basicdiabetes model we built in class. You will need to rerun the model multiple times to do so.\n",

    "Parameter              Correlation with Precision                     Correlation with Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "#### estimators : estimators are number of tree in the forest. it has default value of 100 but you can increase value. As we increase the number of estimators in the model precision and recall both gets increase but after certain number it goes down and stays the same for higher number of estimator. so until certain number it is positively correlated to precision and recall and then after that point it is negatively correlated to both.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### max_depth : It represents maximum number of depth. in other word how many steps can original node go down until leaf. It increases percision and recall until certain number so postively correlated to precision and recall and then it does not change after that number so remains the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### min_samples_split : it represents minimum number of sample requires for internal node split. Default is 2. As we increase number for min_samples_split, accuracy and recall goes down and sometimes for one class it goes up and for another class it goes down and because of this average for precision and recall sometimes goes down and sometimes goes up little. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### min_samples_leaf : it is minimum number of samples requires for leaf node with default being 1. As we increase number for the min_samples_leaf we can see precision and recall sometimes decreses and sometimes increases so there is no correlation because it goes positive and negative both direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### min_weight_fraction_leaf : The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. default is 0.0. As we increase this parameter, precision goes down for certain number but then it started to go up whereas recall has negative correlation with it because as this number increases recall number goes down.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### max_leaf_nodes : grows trees with number of leaf nodes provided in this parameters. Default is None. When we increase this parameters precision and recall both goes up along with it. so precision and recall both are correlated with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### min_impurity_decrease : A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value. default value is 0.0. As we increase this parameters, precision and recall average values goes down. So it is negatively correlated to precision and recall. In other words, As min_impurity_decrease goes up, precision and recall goes down and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### min_impurity_split : Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf. Default value is None. I was not able to figure out correlation because i got below error message.\n",
